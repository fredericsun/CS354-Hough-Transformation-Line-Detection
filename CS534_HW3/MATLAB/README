1. In challenge1a, I choose the "canny" method to generate edge image because the "canny" can generate a better edege image than "sobel". 

2. For the bin number choice, I put 800 to the rho_number_bins because the length of diagonal which is the maximum value of rho in the Hough Space is less than 800. I put 180 to the theta_number_bins so that every 1 degree can fit in the Hough Space. Therefore, the range of rho is -800 to 800, and the range of theta is 0 to 180(degree measure) in the Hough Space. My voting mechanism is exactly the same as Hough Algorithm. If one pixel's value is not 0 in the edge image, it means that the pixel is edge. Then I calculate the rho and theta value for that pixel and vote for it. Regarding to negative value of rho, I add a 400 to every rho value to make sure it appers to be positive in the Hough Space.

3. In the LineFinder method, the peak value I choose is just the max vote value in the Hough Space. Then after mutiple times of testing the threshold value for the three images. I finally decide to use 0.55, 0.45, 0.47. If the corresponding Hough Space's particular vote is greater than the threshold*most_vote. Then I mmark the (rho, theta) value and plot it out later.
